Mathematical modeling - Numerical methods:
=====================

This repository contains MATLAB files of various algorithms or computational methods to numerically solve a mathematical equation. 

Numerical methods are applied (i) when no closed form solution exists for an equation or (ii) in case of computational time and money exceeds the budget. It provides us with a numerical solution that is close to the analytical solution (if exists). Although we are compromising a little on the accuracy of the result, we will be able to solve the problem much faster than what would have taken to come up with an analytical solution (if exists). 

There are numerous problems in science that fall into this category. I have applied few powerful numerical methods to comeup with an accurate solution to the problems.
